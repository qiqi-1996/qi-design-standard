## Development Environment

I use [`Docute`](https://docute.org) to host the documentation website for now, and it is very convenience because:

> it is totally runtime-driven so there are no server-side components involved which also means there's no build process.

But I still create some scripts to let documentation compose more convenience, use `npm install` to get the environment ready.

### Auto Reload

After the environment got ready, use `npm start` to start it up and visit the URL come out of the console. And every time you modify the files inner the docs directory will make the browser auto-reload, so you can see the changes immediately.
